## How to Use

Let's say a user names Amara wants to use this app. 
- Firstly she needs to key in the price of the first item she wants to buy. 
- If she keys in an incorrect price, she can correct it by using the red backspace button. 
- But if she has keyed in the correct value, she can press the green tick button to signal that to the app. 
- A box will appear asking her what item she bought. 
- Once she types in the item she bought, the app saved it.
- She can now view the item on the History page.
- She can do the same for every item she buys, and just like that, we have helped Amara track her spending.
